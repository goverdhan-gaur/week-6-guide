# QUICK DECISION MATRIX

## IF ROAS IS...

**> 4.0x (Excellent)**

✅ Scale aggressively
```

**3.0-4.0x (Great)**
```
✅ Increase budgets 20%

```

**2.0-3.0x (Good/Profitable)**
```

⚠️ Try new angles
```

```
⚠️ Decrease budgets 30%
⚠️ Pause underperformers
⚠️ Focus on email (free)
```

**< 1.5x (Losing Money)**
```
❌ Pause all campaigns
❌ Diagnose issue
❌ Fix, then relaunch at $50/day
```

# EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

## ADS NOT DELIVERING

**Check:**
1. Account spending limit (Meta Business Settings)
2. Payment method valid
3. Ads approved (check Ads Manager status)
4. Budgets sufficient ($50+ minimum)

**Fix:**
- Increase spending limit
- Update payment method
- Edit rejected ads
- Increase budgets

---

## NO SALES (ADS RUNNING BUT 0 CONVERSIONS)

**After $200 spend with 0 sales:**

**Check:**
1. Pixel firing? (use Facebook Pixel Helper)
2. Clicks happening? (CTR > 1%?)
3. Add-to-carts? (check Shopify analytics)

**Diagnose:**
- No clicks = Bad creative (remake ad)
- Clicks but no ATCs = Bad landing page
- ATCs but no purchases = Checkout friction (shipping cost? payment issues?)

**Fix:**
- Bad creative → New ad with different image/copy
- Bad landing page → Simplify, add trust badges
- Checkout friction → Free shipping, trust signals

---

## EMAIL NOT SENDING

**Check:**
1. Klaviyo connected to Shopify?
2. Email flow active (not draft)?
3. Segment not empty?
4. SPF/DKIM authenticated?

**Fix:**
- Reconnect integration
- Set flow to "Live"
- Check segment size
- Contact Klaviyo support for authentication

---

## HIGH CART ABANDONMENT (>80%)

**Reasons:**
1. Unexpected shipping cost → Offer free shipping
2. No trust signals → Add badges, reviews
3. Complicated checkout → Simplify
4. Price shock → Show value (compare to retail)

**Quick fixes:**
- Add "Free Shipping" banner
- Display "100-night trial" clearly
- Add Trustpilot reviews to checkout
- Email abandoned carts faster (30 min instead of 1 hour)

---

# TIME-SAVING SHORTCUTS

## Bulk Updates (Shopify)

**Update multiple products at once:**
```
Products → Select products (checkbox) → Bulk edit
Can edit: Prices, descriptions, tags, collections
```

## Duplicate Ads (Meta)

**Instead of creating from scratch:**
```
Select ad → Duplicate → Change one variable
Saves 80% of time
```

## Schedule Posts (Social)

**Use Meta Business Suite:**
```
Create post → Schedule → Set date/time
Plan entire week on Sunday
```

## Email Templates (Klaviyo)

**Save as template:**
```
Create email once → Save as Template
Reuse for future campaigns
```

---

# FINAL REMINDERS

**DO:**
✅ Track everything daily
✅ Trust the data, not feelings
✅ Test one variable at a time
✅ Respond to customers within 2 hours
✅ Keep inventory stocked
✅ Sleep 7+ hours (you need energy)

**DON'T:**
❌ Change everything at once
❌ Panic after Day 1
❌ Run 10 offers simultaneously
❌ Ignore customer emails
❌ Overspend without sales
❌ Forget to eat and hydrate

---
